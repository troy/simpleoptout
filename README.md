## Welcome

**Simple Opt Out** is drawing attention to opt-out data sharing and marketing practices that many people aren't aware of (and most people don't want), then making it easier to opt out. For example:

   * **[Chase](#chase)** may share your "account balances and transaction history … For nonaffiliates to market to you."
   * **[Crate & Barrel](#crate--barrel)** shares "your customer information [name, postal address and email address, and transactions you conduct on our Website or offline] with other select companies."
   * **[InterContinental Hotels](#intercontinental-hotels)** may share "your information with third parties … to extend special offers about their own products and services"

This site makes it easier to opt out of data sharing by 100+ companies (or [request a company](#changes) or see [opt-out tips](#suggestions)). Enjoy!

PS: If you haven't done so already, [install uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/).

# Suggestions

## Your other relationships

Think about your other…

* Internet-connected devices: if your TV, thermostat, toothbrush, speakers, or other household device has an Internet connection (even through Bluetooth), it probably sends some data to someone else.
* Magazine subscriptions: about half of magazines sell at least print subscriber data.
* Print catalogs/postal ads. When you receive a catalog or flyer, take a picture of the mailing label and email it to the company's support address with a request to be removed from all mailings. If you haven't ordered from the company, ask how they obtained your address.
* Financial services: Banks and anyone involved with your money or extending credit probably shares some data.


### How to find opt-out choices quickly

For companies not listed here:

1. Navigate to a company's privacy policy by searching the Web for `companyname privacy policy`. Example: [at&t privacy policy](https://www.google.com/search?q=at%26t+privacy+policy)
2. Once viewing the privacy policy, skim it for a section called "Your Choices."
3. If you don't see a "Your Choices" link, use your browser to find within the page (Control-F/Command-F). Find for each of these 3 words: "`opt`" (such as "opt-out" and "optout"), "`shar`" (such as "sharing" and "shared"), and "`disclos`" (such as "disclose" and "disclosure").


### Ready-made opt-out request

If you need to email a vendor, here's a request which can be copy-and-pasted:

Hello,

Please remove me from all mailing lists (electronic, postal, and otherwise). Please opt me out of all data sharing.

Please ensure I'm not contacted again except regarding an action that I initiated (such as by placing an order or opening a support ticket), and that no information about me or my use of your services is disclosed except as may be required to deliver the service.

Please reply when this is complete.

Finally, please pass this on to the company's management team or your supervisor: I expect and deserve opt-in, self-service choices about how my data is used and how I'm marketed to. I shouldn't need to opt-out, let alone by sending an email like this. I'm disappointed that the company chose to violate my privacy rather than ensuring it has my informed consent. Because the company puts its own preferences above my own (and even above simple transparency), I can't trust it. I'll be much less likely to make a future purchase. Please move to opt-in, user-facing privacy and marketing choices.


## Install uBlock Origin

[Install uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#installation) for your browser. It's free, not-for-profit, and open source, and using it probably blocks as many privacy concerns as opting out of everything above.


# Changes

## Additions and updates

To submit an opt-out policy for a new company, correction about an existing company, or suggest a feature, please  [tweet to @simpleoptout](https://twitter.com/simpleoptout), or create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/troy/simpleoptout/issues) (or send a [pull request](https://github.com/troy/simpleoptout)).

This site is generally concerned with practices that:

* require opting out, not opting in, and
* do not inherently disclose a way to opt-out (for example, emails generally contain unsubscribe links), and
* are not addressed by industry-wide opt-out like [DMAchoice](https://dmachoice.thedma.org/) (for direct mail), [NAI](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/) and [DAA](http://optout.aboutads.info/) (for ad targeting)
* probably affect at least 1,000 people
